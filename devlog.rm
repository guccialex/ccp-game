nov 30th:

I've restructured the entire chesspokerpackage and pushed a commit indicating that it compiles now, like its the first of the long arduous steps
of weeding out the errors that prevents it from the next step of actually rendering something
but damn
it actually runs like before the restructuring, with some issues, but it even lets me play cards to the board

man, i really like rust

the "if it compiles it works"

is fucking true in a way unlike in any other language
